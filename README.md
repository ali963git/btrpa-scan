## Features

- **Discover All Devices** - Scan for all broadcasting BLE devices in range with signal strength, estimated distance, manufacturer data, and service UUIDs
- **Targeted Search** - Search for a specific device by MAC address and monitor every detection
- **IRK Resolution** - Resolve Resolvable Private Addresses against one or more Identity Resolving Keys to identify devices using randomized addresses for privacy
- **Multiple IRKs** - Load multiple IRKs from a file to resolve addresses for several devices in a single scan
- **RSSI Filtering** - Filter out weak signals with a minimum RSSI threshold
- **RSSI Averaging** - Sliding window average smooths noisy BLE RSSI readings for more stable distance estimates
- **Name Filtering** - Filter devices by name with case-insensitive substring matching
- **Active Scanning** - Send SCAN_REQ to get SCAN_RSP with additional service UUIDs and device names that passive scanning misses
- **Environment Presets** - Indoor, outdoor, and free-space path-loss models for more accurate distance estimation
- **Proximity Alerts** - Audible/visual alert when a device is estimated within a configurable distance
- **Live TUI** - Curses-based live-updating table sorted by signal strength
- **Real-Time CSV Log** - Stream each detection to a CSV file as it happens
- **Batch Export** - Export results to CSV, JSON, or JSONL at end of scan (supports stdout with `-o -`)
- **GPS Location Stamping** - Tag each detection with GPS coordinates via gpsd; tracks per-device best location (strongest RSSI = closest proximity). On by default, degrades gracefully if gpsd is unavailable
- **Multi-Adapter** - Scan with multiple Bluetooth adapters simultaneously (Linux)
- **Verbose/Quiet Modes** - Verbose mode shows additional details (e.g. non-matching RPAs in IRK mode); quiet mode suppresses per-device output and shows only the summary

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Bluetooth hardware
- OS support: macOS, Linux, Windows
- **gpsd** (optional) — required for GPS location stamping

### Installing gpsd

GPS location stamping requires the `gpsd` daemon running with a connected GPS receiver. If gpsd is not running, btrpa-scan continues normally without GPS.

| Platform | Install | Start |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **macOS** | `brew install gpsd` | `gpsd -n /dev/tty.usbserial-*` |
| **Debian/Ubuntu** | `sudo apt install gpsd gpsd-clients` | `sudo systemctl start gpsd` |
| **Fedora/RHEL** | `sudo dnf install gpsd gpsd-clients` | `sudo systemctl start gpsd` |
| **Arch** | `sudo pacman -S gpsd` | `sudo systemctl start gpsd` |
| **Windows** | Use gpsd via WSL or MSYS2 | See WSL instructions above |

To verify gpsd is working:

```bash
# Check that gpsd is listening
gpspipe -w -n 5
# Or use the curses monitor
cgps
```

### Platform Notes

| Platform | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **macOS** | Uses CoreBluetooth. IRK mode leverages an undocumented API to retrieve real Bluetooth addresses instead of UUIDs. `--active` has no effect — CoreBluetooth always scans actively. |
| **Linux** | May require `root` or `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability for scanning. |
| **Windows** | Native WinRT Bluetooth API — real MAC addresses available natively. TUI requires `pip install windows-curses`. |

### Mode 1: Discover All Devices

Scan for all broadcasting BLE devices (default 30-second timeout):

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all
```

With a custom timeout:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all -t 60
```

### Mode 2: Targeted Search

Search for a specific device by MAC address:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

### Mode 3: IRK Resolution

Resolve Resolvable Private Addresses using an Identity Resolving Key. This mode runs indefinitely by default until stopped with `Ctrl+C`:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --irk 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
```

The IRK can be provided in several formats:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Plain hex | `0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF` |
| Colon-separated | `01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF:01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF` |
| Dash-separated | `01-23-45-67-89-AB-CD-EF-01-23-45-67-89-AB-CD-EF` |
| 0x-prefixed | `0x0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF` |

#### IRK from a File

Load one or more IRKs from a file. Each line should contain one IRK in any supported hex format. Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --irk-file keys.txt
```

Example `keys.txt`:

```
# Alice's phone
0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
# Bob's watch
FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210
```

When multiple IRKs are loaded, each detected RPA is checked against all keys. The summary shows total matches across all keys.

#### IRK from Environment Variable

Set the `BTRPA_IRK` environment variable to avoid passing the key on the command line:

```bash
export BTRPA_IRK=0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
python3 btrpa-scan.py
```

Priority: `--irk` > `--irk-file` > `BTRPA_IRK`

### RSSI Filtering

Only show devices with signal strength above a threshold:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --min-rssi -70
```

### RSSI Averaging

BLE RSSI is inherently noisy. Use a sliding window average for more stable distance estimates and to filter out spurious weak detections:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --rssi-window 5
```

When windowing is active, the display shows both raw and averaged RSSI (e.g. `RSSI: -65 dBm (avg: -62 dBm over 5 readings)`), and distance estimation uses the averaged value. The `--min-rssi` filter also applies to the averaged RSSI, preventing a single noisy spike from dropping a device.

### Name Filtering

Filter devices by name using a case-insensitive substring match:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --name-filter "AirPods"
```

Only devices whose advertised name contains the given pattern will be shown. Devices with no name are excluded when a name filter is active.

### Active Scanning

Passive scanning (the default) only sees advertisements. Active scanning sends `SCAN_REQ` and gets `SCAN_RSP`, which can reveal additional service UUIDs and device names:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --active
```

> **Note:** On macOS, CoreBluetooth always scans actively regardless of this flag. On Linux/BlueZ, active scanning may require root or `CAP_NET_ADMIN`.

### Environment Presets

Distance estimation uses a path-loss exponent that varies by environment. The default (`free_space`, n=2.0) assumes no obstructions. For more realistic estimates indoors:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --environment indoor
```

| Preset | Path-Loss Exponent (n) | Use Case |
|--------|------------------------|----------|
| `free_space` | 2.0 | Open air, line of sight |
| `outdoor` | 2.2 | Parks, parking lots |
| `indoor` | 3.0 | Offices, homes, buildings |

Higher `n` values produce larger distance estimates for the same RSSI, reflecting signal attenuation from walls and obstacles.

### Reference RSSI Calibration

By default btrpa-scan derives the expected RSSI at 1 metre from the advertised TX Power using an empirically validated 59 dB offset (the iBeacon standard). For even better accuracy you can supply a calibrated value measured in your own environment:

1. Place the target device exactly 1 metre from the scanner.
2. Run a short scan and note the average RSSI.
3. Pass that value with `--ref-rssi`:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --ref-rssi -55
```

When `--ref-rssi` is set, TX Power is ignored entirely. This also enables distance estimates for devices that don't advertise TX Power.

### Proximity Alerts

Trigger an audible bell and visual alert when a device is estimated within a given distance. Requires that the target device advertise TX Power:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --alert-within 5.0
```

Works in all modes including IRK resolution:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --irk <key> --alert-within 3.0
```

### Live TUI

Replace scrolling output with a live-updating terminal table, sorted by signal strength:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --tui
```

The TUI shows all detected devices in a compact table with address, name, RSSI, averaged RSSI, estimated distance, detection count, and last-seen time. Resolved IRK matches are shown in bold, and devices within the `--alert-within` threshold are highlighted.

Combine with other flags:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --irk <key> --tui --rssi-window 5 --environment indoor --alert-within 5.0
```

### Real-Time CSV Log

Stream each detection to a CSV file as it happens (useful for long-running scans where you want incremental data):

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --log scan.csv
```

This can be combined with `--output` for a separate batch export:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --log live.csv --output json -o results.json
```

### Batch Export

Export all results at end of scan in CSV, JSON, or JSONL (JSON Lines) format:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output json -o results.json -t 30
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output csv -t 30
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output jsonl -o results.jsonl -t 30
```

JSONL writes one JSON object per line, making it easy to pipe through `jq`:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output jsonl -o results.jsonl -t 10
cat results.jsonl | jq .
```

Write output to stdout for piping:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output json -o - -t 10 -q | jq .
```

### Multi-Adapter Scanning (Linux)

Scan with multiple Bluetooth adapters simultaneously for wider coverage:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --adapters hci0,hci1
```

Each adapter runs its own scanner instance sharing the same detection callback. All detections are merged into a single output.

### GPS Location Stamping

GPS is **on by default**. Each detection is tagged with the current GPS coordinates from gpsd. The scanner also tracks the **best GPS fix per device** — the coordinates from the detection with the strongest RSSI (closest proximity = most accurate location).

If gpsd is not running, the scanner prints a note and continues normally without GPS:

```bash
# With gpsd running — detections include lat/lon
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output json

# Without gpsd — works fine, GPS fields are empty
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all

# Explicitly disable GPS (skips connection attempt)
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --no-gps
```

GPS coordinates appear in:
- **Console output** — "Best GPS" line per device
- **TUI settings bar** — current fix coordinates
- **Header** — GPS connection status
- **Summary tables** — "Best GPS" column per device
- **All exports** (CSV, JSON, JSONL, real-time log) — `latitude`, `longitude`, `gps_altitude` fields

### Quiet and Verbose Modes

Run in quiet mode (summary only, no per-device output — useful with `--output` or `--log`):

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all -q --output json -t 30
```

Run in verbose mode (show non-matching RPAs in IRK mode):

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --irk 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF -v
```

## How RPA Resolution Works

Bluetooth Low Energy devices use Resolvable Private Addresses (RPAs) to prevent tracking. An RPA is a temporary MAC address that changes periodically, but can be resolved by anyone who possesses the device's Identity Resolving Key (IRK).

An RPA consists of:
- **prand** (3 bytes) - A random value with the top two bits set to `01`
- **hash** (3 bytes) - Computed as `AES-128-ECB(IRK, padding || prand)` truncated to 3 bytes

btrpa-scan implements the `ah()` function from the Bluetooth Core Specification (Vol 3, Part H, Section 2.2.2) to resolve these addresses in real time.

> **Note on AES-ECB:** The use of AES in ECB mode for the `ah()` function is mandated by the Bluetooth Core Specification. Because only a single 16-byte block is ever encrypted, ECB's lack of diffusion across blocks is irrelevant — this is not a vulnerability.

## Security Considerations

- **IRK on the command line:** Command-line arguments are visible to other users on the system via `ps`. To avoid exposing the IRK, use `--irk-file` to read from a file, or set the `BTRPA_IRK` environment variable. Console output masks IRKs by default (showing only the first and last 4 hex characters).
- **GPS coordinates in exports:** All export formats (CSV, JSON, JSONL) and console output include GPS coordinates when available. If sharing scan results, be aware that your location may be disclosed. Use `--no-gps` to disable GPS entirely.
- **Output file paths:** The `--output-file` and `--log` options write to the specified path. Ensure the destination has appropriate permissions for your use case.
